This Student Management System is a Python-based command-line application designed to manage student records efficiently using core programming concepts. The project implements complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and stores data persistently using file handling, ensuring records are saved even after the program exits. It features a menu-driven interface, input validation, and structured data storage using dictionaries. This project demonstrates my understanding of Python fundamentals, data structures, functions, file handling, and problem-solving skills while building a real-world mini application from scratch.
